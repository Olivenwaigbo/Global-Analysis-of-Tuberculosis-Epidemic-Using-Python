# Global Analysis of Tuberculosis Epidemic Using Python

## Introduction
Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs. It is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, talks, or sneezes.

The symptoms of active pulmonary TB include a cough lasting longer than three weeks, coughing up blood or phlegm, chest pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss.

Strategies to address the global health challenge of TB are outlined and endorsed by both the United Nations and the World Health Organization known as the SDGs and WHO‚Äôs End TB Strategy with the target for 2035 being a 95% reduction in TB deaths and a 90% reduction in Number of TB incidence compared with 2015.

## Project Strategy
The dataset was downloaded from the WHO website and the Python libraries used on this project were Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dashboard was designed with Tableau and Figma.
The main steps for this project are summarized below:
* Data Preparation/Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Insights
* Recommendations

##  Key Insights 
 A total of 1.7 million people died from TB in 2021(including about 186,000 people with HIV).
* The total number of TB cases recorded between year 2000 to 2021 is estimated at 247 million people which equate to 3.142% of the population.
* People living with both HIV and TB were 29.5 Million. 
* 42 Million deaths were recorded from 2000 till 2021 while death in HIV positive patients from TB was 10.4 Million.
* India(76.65M), Indonesia(18.38M), Bangladesh(7.29M) and Myanmar(5.01M) accounted for 43% of Total cases making South East Asian the region with the highest incidence of TB.
* Number of deaths decreased with number of incidence till 2019 (lowest point) and increased in 2020 and 2021. This could be as a result of COVID-19. 

## Recommendations

* The use of rapid molecular diagnostic tests as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis should be encouraged as early high diagnostic accuracy will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB.
* Patients who are HIV positive with TB should be given priority due to compromised immune systems.
* More work still needs to be done especially in the Southeast Asian region and the Eastern Mediterranean region to reduce the incidence of TB in other to achieve the 2035 goal.
